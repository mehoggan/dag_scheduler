# Change Notes

## Wednesday March 30, 2021
On OSx Big Sur one needs to:
```
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
after installing xcode from the App Store.

## Wednesday December 1, 2021
* The following file: nboostbeast/include/boost/core/noinit_adaptor.hpp needs
to have its contents changed to

```
template<class U>
void destroy(U* p) {
    using UClass = typename U::U;
    p->~UClass();
    (void)p;
} 
```

in order for it to compile on OSX Big Sur.
