# Change Notes

## Tuesday October 18, 2022

Mac is still having issues reading from the socket when built with CMake. For
the time being, I will migrate over to using autoconf.

## Thursday September 29, 2022

On Fedora release 36 one must run
```bash
> sudo dnf -y install perl
```
if perl is not already installed, otherwise the openssl build will fail <br />
to configure.

Furthermore, on Fedora release 36 libuuid is needed along with its <br />
development package. Doxygen was also installed to remove a CMake warning <br />
with:

```bash
> sudo dnf install -y uuid-c++ uuid-c++-devel libuuid-devel
> sudo dnf install -y doxygen
```

## Wednesday March 30, 2021
On OSx Big Sur one needs to:
```bash
> sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
after installing xcode from the App Store.

## Wednesday December 1, 2021
* The following file: boostbeast/include/boost/core/noinit_adaptor.hpp <br />
needs to have its contents changed to

```c++
template<class U>
void destroy(U* p) {
    using UClass = typename U::U;
    p->~UClass();
    (void)p;
} 
```
in order for it to compile on OSX Big Sur.

## Tuesday August 17, 2021
* Added in ycm changes to support development in Mac OSX.
* Work done on adding tasks to scheduler.
  * Checked interuptible_task_thread for tests.

## WIP: Sunday March 22, 2020
* Added in ycm changes to support development in Ubuntu 18.04 after a <br />
  long break from development.
